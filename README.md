space note - general instruction at spacenote.domain
spacenote.domain.red_lion_salad where you can post something
SQL
need to figure out routing and the construction of space 
the homepage will take you to a space. that basically becomes yours. lives for a while...i dont know. everything just writes to a database.

your space may live for a few days, I dont know. you may be able to edit, but you can definitely post to this thing 

maybe a protected space option too 

todo:
express needs to be creating the space name. 
the space name gets shown to user on homescreen
the user then clicks the spacename and goes to it
the user has to edit the page with something. this save action is what actually saves the space in the db!
